  "body": "Flipflop is a Google Chrome extension that helps indecisive people make decisions between two options by posting HITs on Mechanical Turk. This is currently in development mode, and will be posting HITs to workersandbox.mturk.com\r\n\r\n## How to install:\r\n1. Clone/download the extension to your machine\r\n2. Navigate to chrome://extensions on your Google Chrome\r\n3. Choose \"Load unpacked extension...\"\r\n4. Select the working directory for flipflops\r\n\r\n## How to use:\r\n1. Click on the browser action button\r\n2. Type in a question for context, to present to your worker\r\n3. Select an image from the website or submit a link. There's an option to upload your own image, but tbh it's still buggy.\r\n4. You can switch tabs/select images from different tabs\r\n5. Select the number of workers you want to get opinions from. You can enter any amount, but we recommend an odd number under 20, because you'll be waiting a long time if you choose 5000 and you may even get a tie.\r\n6. Select accelerate if you want immediate result when there's a clear majority.\r\n7. You'll get a chrome notification when a decision is available!\r\n\r\n#### Beware of bugs:\r\n- Uploading your own image is still buggy\r\n- When you submit, don't close the popup until it's done loading, or the HIT won't be posted! This shouldn't take long, but just in case your connection isn't ideal.",
